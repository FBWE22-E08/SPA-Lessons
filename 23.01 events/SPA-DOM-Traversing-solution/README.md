# Extreme Travel Website!

**Instructions**:
* Use only JavaScript to solve the tasks, no changes in the CSS.

* Select the `header` that is the **closest** parent of the `h1` heading. Give the `header` a solid border of 5px. ![alt text](images/header.png "Header")

* If the `.info` section contains an element with the class `.info-package`, select all `.package-title` elements and give the previous sibling element of each a border. ![alt text](images/packages.png "Packages")

* For each info label check if it matches the selector `.mild`. If so, give the label a `yellow` solid border. If the label matches the `.intense` selector, give the label an `orange` solid border. If the class does not match either, give the label a red solid border. ![alt text](images/packages.png "Packages")

* Add a copy of all the children of `.nav-list` to the footer's `.site-map`. Note: the `.nav-list` should keep its children. ![alt text](images/footer.png "Footer")

**Bonus**
After you completed the assignment and published the solution branch, you can create a new branch `feature/restyle` and change the design of the landing-page. You can publish it on GitHub Pages when you are satisfied with the result.
