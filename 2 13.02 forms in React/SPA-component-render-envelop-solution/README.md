# Envelope

## Description

In this exercise, you will create a react component that generates an envelope using the passed addresses and stamp!

## Task

Create an `Envelope` component (`src/Components/Envelope.jsx`) that takes two objects as props: `toPerson` and `fromPerson` and returns an envelope as shown below.

**notes**

- Use a reusable component named `AddressLabel` to add the addresses to the envelope.
- Make sure to include a `Stamp` too!
