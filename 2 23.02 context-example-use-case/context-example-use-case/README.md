# Example context use case
In this example we are looking at the use of a context and a `ContextProviderComponent` all in one context. 

The use case is here that we would like to sign in a user into our application. We want to keep track whether the user has signed in or not. 

## Structure Application

Notice our `src` folder is subdivided in different folders: 
- `components `
- `context`
- `views`
